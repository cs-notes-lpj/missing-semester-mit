本节讲座，we will go through several ways in which you can improve your workflow when using the shell

We have been working with the shell for a while now, but we have mainly focused on executing different commands

We will now see how to run several processes at the same time while keeping track of them, how to stop or pause a specific process and how to make a process run in the background

We will also learn about different ways to improve your shell and other tools, by defining aliases and configuring them using dotfiles

Both of these can help you save time, e.g. by using the same configurations in all your machines without having to type long commands.

We will look at how to work with remote machines using SSH

---

Job Control

In some cases you will need to interrupt a job while it is executing, for instance if a command is taking too long to complete (such as a `find` with a very large directory structure to search through).

Most of the time, you can do `Ctrl-C` and the command will stop.

But how does this actually work and why does it sometimes fail to stop the process?

---

Killing a process

Your shell is using a UNIX communication mechanism called a **signal** to communicate information to the process

When a process receives a signal it stops its execution, deals with the signal and potentially changes the flow of execution based on the information that the signal delivered

For this reason, signals are **software interrupts**

In our case, when typing `Ctrl-C` this prompts the shell to deliver a `SIGINT` signal to the process.

Here’s a minimal example of a Python program that captures `SIGINT` and ignores it, no longer stopping.

To kill this program we can now use the `SIGQUIT` signal instead, by typing `Ctrl-\`.

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python
import signal, time

def handler(signum, time):
    print("\nI got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping")

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handler)

i = 0
while True:
    time.sleep(.1)
    print("\r{}".format(i), end="")
    i += 1
```

Here’s what happens if we send `SIGINT` twice to this program, followed by `SIGQUIT`

Note that `^` is how `Ctrl` is displayed when typed in the terminal

```shell
$ python sigint.py
24^C
I got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping
26^C
I got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping
30^\[1]    39913 quit       python sigint.py
```

While `SIGINT` and `SIGQUIT` are both usually associated with terminal related requests, a more generic signal for asking a process to exit gracefully is the `SIGTERM` signal.

To send this signal we can use the [kill](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/kill.1.html) command, with the syntax `kill -TERM <PID>`.

---

Pausing and backgrounding processes

Signals can do other things beyond killing a process.

For instance, `SIGSTOP` pauses a process. In the terminal, typing `Ctrl-Z` will prompt the shell to send a `SIGTSTP` signal, short for Terminal Stop (i.e. the terminal’s version of `SIGSTOP`).

We can then continue the paused job in the foreground or in the background using [fg](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/fg.1p.html) or [bg](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bg.1p.html), respectively.

The [jobs](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/jobs.1p.html) command lists the unfinished jobs associated with the current terminal session.

You can refer to those jobs using their pid (you can use [pgrep](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pgrep.1.html) to find that out).

More intuitively, you can also refer to a process using the percent symbol followed by its job number (displayed by `jobs`).

To refer to **the last backgrounded job** you can use the `$!` special parameter.

One more thing to know is that the `&` suffix in a command will run the command in the background, giving you the prompt back, although it will still use the shell’s STDOUT which can be annoying (use shell redirections in that case).

![20220803134831](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20220803134831.png)

To background an already running program you can do `Ctrl-Z` followed by `bg`

Note that backgrounded processes are still children processes of your terminal and will die if you close the terminal (this will send yet another signal, `SIGHUP`)

To prevent that from happening you can run the program with [nohup](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/nohup.1.html) (a wrapper to ignore `SIGHUP`), or use `disown` if the process has already been started.

Alternatively, you can use a terminal multiplexer as we will see in the next section.

Below is a sample session to showcase some of these concepts.

```shell
$ sleep 1000
^Z
[1]  + 18653 suspended  sleep 1000

$ nohup sleep 2000 &
[2] 18745
appending output to nohup.out

$ jobs
[1]  + suspended  sleep 1000
[2]  - running    nohup sleep 2000

$ bg %1
[1]  - 18653 continued  sleep 1000

$ jobs
[1]  - running    sleep 1000
[2]  + running    nohup sleep 2000

$ kill -STOP %1
[1]  + 18653 suspended (signal)  sleep 1000

$ jobs
[1]  + suspended (signal)  sleep 1000
[2]  - running    nohup sleep 2000

$ kill -SIGHUP %1
[1]  + 18653 hangup     sleep 1000

$ jobs
[2]  + running    nohup sleep 2000

$ kill -SIGHUP %2

$ jobs
[2]  + running    nohup sleep 2000

$ kill %2
[2]  + 18745 terminated  nohup sleep 2000

$ jobs
```

A special signal is `SIGKILL` since it cannot be captured by the process and it will always terminate it immediately. However, it can have bad side effects such as leaving orphaned children processes.

You can learn more about these and other signals [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)) or typing [man signal](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html) or `kill -l`.

Terminal Multiplexers

When using the command line interface you will often want to run more than one thing at once.

For instance, you might want to run your editor and your program side by side.

Although this can be achieved by opening new terminal windows, using a terminal multiplexer is a more versatile solution.

Terminal multiplexers like [tmux](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tmux.1.html) allow you to multiplex terminal windows using panes and tabs so you can interact with multiple shell sessions. 

Moreover, terminal multiplexers let you detach a current terminal session and reattach at some point later in time.

This can make your workflow much better when working with remote machines since it avoids the need to use `nohup` and similar tricks.

The most popular terminal multiplexer these days is [tmux](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tmux.1.html). `tmux` is highly configurable and by using the associated keybindings you can create multiple tabs and panes and quickly navigate through them.

`tmux` expects you to know its keybindings, and they all have the form `<C-b> x` where that means (1) press `Ctrl+b`, (2) release `Ctrl+b`, and then (3) press `x`. `tmux` has the following hierarchy of objects:

---

- Sessions - a session is an independent workspace with one or more windows

    - `tmux` starts a new session.
    - `tmux new -s NAME` starts it with that name.
    - `tmux ls` lists the current sessions
    - Within tmux typing `<C-b> d` detaches the current session
    - `tmux a` attaches the last session. You can use `-t` flag to specify which

- Windows - Equivalent to tabs in editors or browsers, they are visually separate parts of the same session

    - `<C-b> c` Creates a new window. To close it you can just terminate the shells doing `<C-d>`
    - `<C-b> N` Go to the **N** th window. Note they are numbered
    - `<C-b> p` Goes to the previous window
    - `<C-b> n` Goes to the next window
    - `<C-b> ,` Rename the current window
    - `<C-b> w` List current windows

- Panes - Like vim splits, panes let you have multiple shells in the same visual display.

    - `<C-b> "` Split the current pane horizontally
    - `<C-b> %` Split the current pane vertically
    - `<C-b> <direction>` Move to the pane in the specified direction. Direction here means arrow keys.
    - `<C-b> z` Toggle zoom for the current pane
    - `<C-b> [` Start scrollback. You can then press `<space>` to start a selection and `<enter>` to copy that selection.
    - `<C-b> <space>` Cycle through pane arrangements.

For further reading, [here](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/) is a quick tutorial on `tmux` and [this](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_adv_termmux.php) has a more detailed explanation that covers the original `screen` command. You might also want to familiarize yourself with [screen](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/screen.1.html), since it comes installed in most UNIX systems.
