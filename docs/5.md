本节讲座，we will go through several ways in which you can improve your workflow when using the shell

We have been working with the shell for a while now, but we have mainly focused on executing different commands

We will now see how to run several processes at the same time while keeping track of them, how to stop or pause a specific process and how to make a process run in the background

We will also learn about different ways to improve your shell and other tools, by defining aliases and configuring them using dotfiles

Both of these can help you save time, e.g. by using the same configurations in all your machines without having to type long commands.

We will look at how to work with remote machines using SSH

Job Control

In some cases you will need to interrupt a job while it is executing, for instance if a command is taking too long to complete (such as a `find` with a very large directory structure to search through).

Most of the time, you can do `Ctrl-C` and the command will stop.

But how does this actually work and why does it sometimes fail to stop the process?

Killing a process

Your shell is using a UNIX communication mechanism called a **signal** to communicate information to the process

When a process receives a signal it stops its execution, deals with the signal and potentially changes the flow of execution based on the information that the signal delivered

For this reason, signals are **software interrupts**

In our case, when typing `Ctrl-C` this prompts the shell to deliver a `SIGINT` signal to the process.

Here’s a minimal example of a Python program that captures `SIGINT` and ignores it, no longer stopping.

To kill this program we can now use the `SIGQUIT` signal instead, by typing `Ctrl-\`.

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python
import signal, time

def handler(signum, time):
    print("\nI got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping")

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handler)

i = 0
while True:
    time.sleep(.1)
    print("\r{}".format(i), end="")
    i += 1
```

Here’s what happens if we send `SIGINT` twice to this program, followed by `SIGQUIT`

Note that `^` is how `Ctrl` is displayed when typed in the terminal

```zsh
$ python sigint.py
24^C
I got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping
26^C
I got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping
30^\[1]    39913 quit       python sigint.py
```

While `SIGINT` and `SIGQUIT` are both usually associated with terminal related requests, a more generic signal for asking a process to exit gracefully is the `SIGTERM` signal.

To send this signal we can use the [kill](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/kill.1.html) command, with the syntax `kill -TERM <PID>`.

---

Pausing and backgrounding processes

Signals can do other things beyond killing a process.

For instance, `SIGSTOP` pauses a process. In the terminal, typing `Ctrl-Z` will prompt the shell to send a `SIGTSTP` signal, short for Terminal Stop (i.e. the terminal’s version of `SIGSTOP`).

We can then continue the paused job in the foreground or in the background using [fg](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/fg.1p.html) or [bg](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bg.1p.html), respectively.

The [jobs](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/jobs.1p.html) command lists the unfinished jobs associated with the current terminal session.

You can refer to those jobs using their pid (you can use [pgrep](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pgrep.1.html) to find that out).

More intuitively, you can also refer to a process using the percent symbol followed by its job number (displayed by `jobs`).

To refer to the last backgrounded job you can use the `$!` special parameter.

One more thing to know is that the `&` suffix in a command will run the command in the background, giving you the prompt back, although it will still use the shell’s STDOUT which can be annoying (use shell redirections in that case).
