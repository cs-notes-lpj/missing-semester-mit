# Version Control (Git)

<iframe width="616" height="347" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sjqTHE0zok" title="Lecture 6: Version Control (git) (2020)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Version control systems (VCSs) are tools used to track changes to source code (or other collections of files and folders).

As the name implies, these tools help maintain a history of changes; furthermore, they facilitate collaboration.

VCSs track changes to a folder and its contents in a series of snapshots, where each snapshot encapsulates the entire state of files/folders within a top-level directory.

VCSs also maintain metadata like who created each snapshot, messages associated with each snapshot, and so on.

Why is version control useful?

Even when you’re working by yourself, it can let you look at old snapshots of a project, keep a log of why certain changes were made, work on parallel branches of development, and much more.

When working with others, it’s an invaluable tool for seeing what other people have changed, as well as resolving conflicts in concurrent development.

Modern VCSs also let you easily (and often automatically) answer questions like:

- Who wrote this module?
- When was this particular line of this particular file edited? By whom? Why was it edited?
- Over the last 1000 revisions, when/why did a particular unit test stop working?

While other VCSs exist, **Git** is the de facto standard for version control.

This [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/1597/) captures Git’s reputation:

Because Git’s interface is a leaky abstraction, learning Git top-down (starting with its interface / command-line interface) can lead to a lot of confusion.

It’s possible to memorize a handful of commands and think of them as magic incantations, and follow the approach in the comic above whenever anything goes wrong.

While Git admittedly has an ugly interface, its underlying design and ideas are beautiful.

While an ugly interface has to be memorized, a beautiful design can be understood.

For this reason, we give a bottom-up explanation of Git, starting with its data model and later covering the command-line interface.

Once the data model is understood, the commands can be better understood in terms of how they manipulate the underlying data model.

---

Git’s data model

There are many ad-hoc approaches you could take to version control. Git has a well-thought-out model that enables all the nice features of version control, like maintaining history, supporting branches, and enabling collaboration.

---

Snapshots

Git models the history of a collection of files and folders within some top-level directory as a series of snapshots.

In Git terminology,

a file is called a “blob”, and it’s just a bunch of bytes.

A directory is called a “tree”, and it maps names to blobs or trees (so directories can contain other directories).

A snapshot is the top-level tree that is being tracked.

For example, we might have a tree as follows:

```
<root> (tree)
|
+- foo (tree)
|  |
|  + bar.txt (blob, contents = "hello world")
|
+- baz.txt (blob, contents = "git is wonderful")
```

The top-level tree contains two elements, a tree “foo” (that itself contains one element, a blob “bar.txt”), and a blob “baz.txt”.

---

Modeling history: relating snapshots

How should a version control system relate snapshots?

One simple model would be to have a linear history. A history would be a list of snapshots in time-order. For many reasons, Git doesn’t use a simple model like this.

In Git, a history is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of snapshots.

That may sound like a fancy math word, but don’t be intimidated.

All this means is that each snapshot in Git refers to a set of “parents”, the snapshots that preceded it.

It’s a set of parents rather than a single parent (as would be the case in a linear history) because a snapshot might descend from multiple parents, for example, due to combining (merging) two parallel branches of development.

Git calls these snapshots “commit”s. Visualizing a commit history might look something like this:

```
o <-- o <-- o <-- o
            ^
             \
              --- o <-- o
```

In the ASCII art above, the `o`s correspond to individual commits (snapshots).

The arrows point to the parent of each commit (it’s a “comes before” relation, not “comes after”).

After the third commit, the history branches into two separate branches. This might correspond to, for example, two separate features being developed in parallel, independently from each other. In the future, these branches may be merged to create a new snapshot that incorporates both of the features, producing a new history that looks like this, with the newly created merge commit shown in bold:

```
o <-- o <-- o <-- o <---- **o**
            ^            /
             \          v
              --- o <-- o
```

Commits in Git are immutable.

This doesn’t mean that mistakes can’t be corrected, however; it’s just that “edits” to the commit history are actually creating entirely new commits, and references (see below) are updated to point to the new ones.

---

Data model, as pseudocode

It may be instructive to see Git’s data model written down in pseudocode:

```
// a file is a bunch of bytes
type blob = array<byte>

// a directory contains named files and directories
type tree = map<string, tree | blob>

// a commit has parents, the top-level tree, and metadata
type commit = struct {
    parents: array<commit>
    snapshot: tree
    author: string
    message: string
}
```

It’s a clean, simple model of history.

---

Objects and content-addressing

An “object” is a blob, tree, or commit:

```
type object = blob | tree | commit
```

In Git data store, all objects are content-addressed by their [SHA-1 hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1).

```
objects = map<string, object>

def store(object):
    id = sha1(object)
    objects[id] = object

def load(id):
    return objects[id]
```

Blobs, trees, and commits are unified in this way: they are all objects.

When they reference other objects, they don’t actually contain them in their on-disk representation, but have a reference to them by their hash.

For example, the tree for the example directory structure under below,

```
<root> (tree)
|
+- foo (tree)
|  |
|  + bar.txt (blob, contents = "hello world")
|
+- baz.txt (blob, contents = "git is wonderful")
```

(visualized using `git cat-file -p 698281bc680d1995c5f4caaf3359721a5a58d48d`), looks like this:

```
100644 blob 4448adbf7ecd394f42ae135bbeed9676e894af85    baz.txt
040000 tree c68d233a33c5c06e0340e4c224f0afca87c8ce87    foo
```

The tree itself contains pointers to its contents, `baz.txt` (a blob) and `foo` (a tree).

If we look at the contents addressed by the hash corresponding to baz.txt with `git cat-file -p 4448adbf7ecd394f42ae135bbeed9676e894af85`, we get the following:

```
git is wonderful
```

---

References

Now, all snapshots can be identified by their SHA-1 hashes.

That’s inconvenient, because humans aren’t good at remembering strings of 40 hexadecimal characters.

Git’s solution to this problem is human-readable names for SHA-1 hashes, called “references”.

References are pointers to commits.

Unlike objects, which are immutable, references are mutable (can be updated to point to a new commit).

For example, the `master` reference usually points to the latest commit in the main branch of development.

```
references = map<string, string>

def update_reference(name, id):
    references[name] = id

def read_reference(name):
    return references[name]

def load_reference(name_or_id):
    if name_or_id in references:
        return load(references[name_or_id])
    else:
        return load(name_or_id)
```

With this, Git can use human-readable names like “master” to refer to a particular snapshot in the history, instead of a long hexadecimal string.

One detail is that we often want a notion of “where we currently are” in the history, so that when we take a new snapshot, we know what it is relative to (how we set the `parents` field of the commit). In Git, that “where we currently are” is a special reference called “HEAD”.

---

Repositories

Finally, we can define what (roughly) is a Git repository: it is the data `objects` and `references`.

On disk, all Git stores are objects and references: that’s all there is to Git’s data model.

All `git` commands map to some manipulation of the commit DAG by adding objects and adding/updating references.

Whenever you’re typing in any command, think about what manipulation the command is making to the underlying graph data structure.

Conversely, if you’re trying to make a particular kind of change to the commit DAG, e.g. “discard uncommitted changes and make the ‘master’ ref point to commit `5d83f9e`”, there’s probably a command to do it (e.g. in this case, `git checkout master; git reset --hard 5d83f9e`).

---

Staging area

This is another concept that’s orthogonal to the data model, but it’s a part of the interface to create commits.

One way you might imagine implementing snapshotting as described above is to have a “create snapshot” command that creates a new snapshot based on the current state of the working directory.

Some version control tools work like this, but not Git.

We want clean snapshots, and it might not always be ideal to make a snapshot from the current state.

For example, imagine a scenario where you’ve implemented two separate features, and you want to create two separate commits, where the first introduces the first feature, and the next introduces the second feature. Or imagine a scenario where you have debugging print statements added all over your code, along with a bugfix; you want to commit the bugfix while discarding all the print statements.

Git accommodates such scenarios by allowing you to specify which modifications should be included in the next snapshot through a mechanism called the “staging area”.

---

Git command-line interface

To avoid duplicating information, we’re not going to explain the commands below in detail. See the highly recommended [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for more information, or watch the lecture video.

---

Basics

- `git help <command>`: get help for a git command
- `git init`: creates a new git repo, with data stored in the .git directory
- `git status`: tells you what’s going on
- `git add <filename>`: adds files to staging area
- `git commit`: creates a new commit
    - [Write good commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)!
    - Even more reasons to [write good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)!
- `git log`: shows a flattened log of history
- `git log --all --graph --decorate`: visualizes history as a DAG
- `git diff <filename>`: show changes you made relative to the staging area
- `git checkout`: 更改 HEAD 指向或 throws away the changes that be made in the working directory and sets the contents of file(s) back to the way it was in the snapshot that HEAD points to.
- `git diff`

git-diff command can show you what's changed since the "last snapshot"

![20220811095715](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20220811095715.png)

注意：其实 git-diff 默认是相对于 HEAD 所指向的节点进行比较的

this means `git diff` == `git diff HEAD`

![20220811102323](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20220811102323.png)

![20220811103538](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20220811103538.png)

---

Branching and merging

- `git branch`: shows branches
- `git branch <name>`: creates a branch (in the beginning, its just define a new reference points the same place where we currently are.)

![20220811110352](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20220811110352.png)

进而，我们就可以切换分支

![20220811111032](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20220811111032.png)

- `git checkout -b <name>`: creates a branch and switches to it
    - same as `git branch <name>; git checkout <name>`

- `git merge` and the good notion of 'Fast-forward' (see the lec-video if you've forgotten)
    - `git merge --abort` is useful too.
    - `git add ` to tell git you have solved the conflict and then `git merge --continue`.

- `git mergetool`: use a fancy tool to help resolve merge conflicts (+vimdiff)

---

Remotes

- `git remote`: list remotes
- `git remote add <name> <url>`: add a remote, `<name>` will usually be 'origin' conventionally.
- `git push <remote> <local branch>:<remote branch>`: creates a new branch or updates a branch on the remote, eg: `git push origin master:master`

![20220811120641](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20220811120641.png)

- `git clone <url> <folder name>`: download repository from remote

- `git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<remote branch>`: set up correspondence between local branch (currently checked out) and remote branch, then you can just execute `git push` to push to git-repo-host-platform for example instead of have to execute `git push origin master:master` things like that.

- `git fetch <remote>`: retrieve objects/references from a remote, if there is only one remote, then the `<remote>` is optional to type into the command-line.

- `git pull`: same as `git fetch; git merge`

---

Undo

- `git reset HEAD <file>`: unstage a file

---

Advanced Git

- `git config`: Git is [highly customizable](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config)
- `git clone --depth=1`: shallow clone, without entire version history
- `git add -p`: interactive staging
- `git rebase -i`: interactive rebasing
- `git blame`: show who last edited which line
- `git stash`: temporarily remove modifications to working directory
- `git bisect`: binary search history (e.g. for regressions)
- `.gitignore`: [specify](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) intentionally untracked files to ignore

---

Miscellaneous

- GUIs: there are many [GUI clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) out there for Git. We personally don’t use them and use the command-line interface instead.
- Shell integration: it’s super handy to have a Git status as part of your shell prompt ([zsh](https://github.com/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt), [bash](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt)). Often included in frameworks like [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).
- Editor integration: similarly to the above, handy integrations with many features. [fugitive.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) is the standard one for Vim.
- Workflows: we taught you the data model, plus some basic commands; we didn’t tell you what practices to follow when working on big projects (and there are [many](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) [different](https://www.endoflineblog.com/gitflow-considered-harmful) [approaches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)).
- GitHub: Git is not GitHub. GitHub has a specific way of contributing code to other projects, called [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
- Other Git providers: GitHub is not special: there are many Git repository hosts, like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

### Notes on the class

model of files and folders

model of history

---

> 以伪代码的形式总结一下刚讲过的东西

```
type blob   = Array<byte>
type tree   = Map<string, blob | tree>
type commit = Struct {
  parents:  Array<commit>
  snapshot: tree
  author:   string
  message:  string
}
```

**This is a really clean simple model of history, and this is basically all there is to how git models history.**

---

how git actually stores and addresses actual data on disk ?

```
type object = blob | tree | commit

# Store
Objects = Map<string, object>
```

存/取 的伪代码如下

```
def store(object):
    id = sha1(object)
    Objects[id] = object

def load(id):
    return Objects[id]
```

**Okay so blobs、trees and commits in git are unified in this way, they are all objects, 然后用它们各自对应的 sha1hash 值来寻址就完事了**

---

但是，sha1hash 是 16 进制的一个由 40 个字符组成的字符序列，对人类来说，这玩意又长又难记。所以，git 就想着给这些 sha1hash 值“起别名”，于是，引用（references）就诞生了

```
References = Map<string, string>
# map human-readable names to hexadecimal string
# eg: fix-encoding-bug ==> 4cdfee627...9ki8f
```

**注意：reference 的指向是可以改变的 ！**

git 的核心原理讲解完毕～

一个 git-repo 最主要的组成部分也就是 objects 和 references

几乎所有的 git-command 实际上也就是在操纵这些 objects 和 references

git 还拥有合理的 “staging area” 的设计和工作方式，It's where you tell git what changes should be included in the next snapshot you take.

就很酷～

一些技巧：

1、git is highly configurable, `git config` ~ `~/.gitconfig`

2、`git clone --shallow`

3、interactively stage pieces of files => `git add -p`

4、`git diff --cached` => [excellent discuss](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1587846/how-do-i-show-the-changes-which-have-been-staged)

5、`git blame` to figure out [author、commit、...] correspond to a line of a file

6、`git show`

![20220811132920](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20220811132920.png)

7、`git stash` and `git stash pop`

8、`git bisect`, not only interactive, but also can take in a script that is used to try to figure out whether a commit looking at is good or bad, so it can be fully automated process like you can give git-bisect a unit test and say:"find the first commit where this unit test stopped passing." a good tutorial video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3ZR_s3NFvM).

9、.gitignore file, specify particular file names or patterns of file names which should be ignored by git.

eg:

```
.DS_Store
*.o
```

10、integration to other programs, such as your shell、your editor、...
