写代码，和写英语作文，其实是两件很不一样的事情

与写一篇长长的英语作文相比，当你写代码的时候，你会在「switching files, reading, navigating, and editing code」上花费更多的时间

所以，人们创造了不同的应用程序来处理这两种不同的事情

比如可以用 Microsoft Word 来写英语作文，可以用 Visual Studio Code 来写代码

作为一名程序员，我们大多数的时间都是在 editing code

因此，挑选一款顺手的编辑器并熟练掌握其使用方式是很有必要的

下面给出了学习一款编辑器的正确姿势

```txt
1. 学习入门教程（比如本讲座 & 我们给出的资源）
2. 坚持使用该编辑器处理你所有的文本编辑工作（即使刚一开始你的效率会有所降低）
3. Look things up as you go: if it seems like there should be a better way to do something, there probably is
```

---

你如果严格按照上面给出的学习方法学习一款新型编辑器，那么学习掌握一款较为复杂的文本编辑器的时间线就会像下面这样

刚开始的一两个小时，你能学会一些基本操作，比如：打开文件、编辑文件、在文件缓冲区中随意浏览、保存退出

一旦你付出了 20 个小时，你的编辑效率就会恢复如初

然后，好处开始凸显：你将会学到越来越多的使用新编辑器的知识和技巧，并形成指尖的肌肉记忆，无形中会节省你大量的时间

现代的文本编辑器是非常奇妙且强大的工具，所以学无止境，你学的越多，you’ll get even faster

---

那么，我们接下来学习哪一款编辑器呢 ？

对于文本编辑器，全世界的程序员们其实[各有所爱](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war)

但当今世界哪些编辑器比较流行呢 ？StackOverflow 有一项相关[调查](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019/#development-environments-and-tools)

但注意：由于 StackOverflow 的用户或许无法代表整个程序员群体，因此这项调查的调查结果可能是有偏见的

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the most popular editor. [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is the most popular command-line-based editor.

本系列教程的 3 位讲师都使用 Vim 这款编辑器，Vim 历史悠久，它继承自 1976 年的 Vi 编辑器，并且时至今日，仍有很多大佬在为 Vim 的发展贡献代码

由于 Vim 这款编辑器的背后其实是有一些很棒的想法和设计，因此，很多其他程序工具都或多或少地提供了 Vim emulation mode

比如，有上百万人安装使用了[Vim emulation for VS code](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim)

因此，即使你最终选择使用其它编辑器，Vim 仍然值得学习

仅用 50 分钟是不可能将 Vim 的所有功能都教给你的，所以我们会专注于给你讲解 the philosophy of Vim

我们会教给你 Vim 的基本使用方法，并向你展示一些 Vim 的高级功能，我们还会给出一些相关资源，方便你自己进一步掌握 Vim

---

Philosophy of Vim:

其实，当你着手编码工作的时候，大多数时间你都是在 reading/editing，而不是 writing

正是因为这样，Vim 被设计成了一款 modal editor

就是说：Vim has different modes for inserting text vs manipulating text

---

Vim is programmable (with Vimscript and also other languages like Python)

Vim’s interface itself is a programming language: keystrokes (with mnemonic names) are commands, and these commands are composable.

---

Vim 不用鼠标，因为太慢；Vim 不用键盘右下角的方向键，因为太远

---

最终，Vim 将会成为一款能让你手速跟得上脑速的编辑器 ！

---

Modal editing:

Vim 是基于这样一个大背景来设计的：大多数程序员的大多数时间其实都是在 reading, navigating, and making small edits

因此，Vim 设计了几种不同的 operating modes:

```txt
1、normal:                      for moving around a file and making edits
2、insert:                      for inserting text
3、replace:                     for replacing text
4、visual(plain,line,block):    for selecting blocks of text
5、command-line:                for running a command
```

当处于不同的 operating modes，Keystrokes have different meanings

比如：the letter `x` in Insert mode will just insert a literal character 'x', but in Normal mode, it will delete the character under the cursor, and in Visual mode, it will delete the selection

In its default configuration, Vim shows the current mode in the bottom left

The initial/default mode is Normal mode

通常情况下，You’ll spend most of your time between Normal mode and Insert mode

---

You change modes by pressing `<ESC>` (the escape key) to switch from any mode back to Normal mode

From Normal mode, enter Insert mode with `i`, Replace mode with `R`, Visual mode with `v`, Visual Line mode with `V`, Visual Block mode with `<C-v>` (Ctrl-V, sometimes also written ^V), and Command-line mode with `:`

---

由于 the `<ESC>` key 很常用，所以不妨 remapping Caps Lock to Escape

[macOS instructions](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Map_caps_lock_to_escape_in_macOS)

---

Basics:

Inserting text

From Normal mode, press `i` to enter Insert mode. Now, Vim behaves like any other text editor, until you press `<ESC>` to return to Normal mode

This, along with the basics explained above, are all you need to start editing files using Vim (though not particularly efficiently, if you’re spending all your time editing from Insert mode).

---

tabs, windows, buffers

Vim maintains a set of open files, called “buffers”.

A Vim session has a number of tabs, each of which has a number of windows (split panes)

Each window shows a single buffer.

Unlike other programs you are familiar with, like web browsers, there is not a 1-to-1 correspondence between buffers and windows; windows are merely views.

A given buffer may be open in multiple windows, even within the same tab.

This can be quite handy, for example, to view two different parts of a file at the same time.

By default, Vim opens with a single tab, which contains a single window.

---

Command-line:

Command mode can be entered by typing `:` in Normal mode.

Your cursor will jump to the command line at the bottom of the screen upon pressing `:`.

This mode has many functionalities, including opening, saving, and closing files, and [quitting](https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/435555976687923200) Vim.

- `:q` quit (close window)
- `:w` save (“write”)
- `:wq` save and quit
- `:e {name of file}` open file for editing
- `:ls` show open buffers
- `:help {topic}` open help
    - `:help :w` opens help for the `:w` command
    - `:help w` opens help for the `w` movement

---

Vim’s interface is a programming language:

The most important idea in Vim is that Vim’s interface itself is a programming language.

Keystrokes (with mnemonic names) are commands, and these commands compose.

This enables efficient movement and edits, especially once the commands become muscle memory.

---

Movement:

You should spend most of your time in Normal mode, using movement commands to navigate the buffer.

Movements in Vim are also called “nouns”, because they refer to chunks of text.

- Basic movement: `hjkl` (left, down, up, right)
- Words: `w` (next word), `b` (beginning of word), `e` (end of word)
- Lines: `0` (beginning of line), `^` (first non-blank character), `$` (end of line)
- Screen: `H` (top of screen), `M` (middle of screen), `L` (bottom of screen)
- Scroll: `Ctrl-u` (up), `Ctrl-d` (down)
- File: `gg` (beginning of file), `G` (end of file)
- Line numbers: `:{number}<CR>` or `{number}G` (line {number})
- Misc: `%` (corresponding item)
- Find: `f{character}`, `t{character}`, `F{character}`, `T{character}`
    - find/to forward/backward {character} on the current line
    - `,` / `;` for navigating matches
- Search: `/{regex}`, `n` / `N` for navigating matches

---

Selection:

Visual modes:

- Visual: `v`
- Visual Line: `V`
- Visual Block: `Ctrl-v`

Can use movement keys to make selection.

---

Edits:

Everything that you used to do with the mouse, you now do with the keyboard using editing commands that compose with movement commands

Here’s where Vim’s interface starts to look like a programming language

Vim’s editing commands are also called “verbs”, because verbs act on nouns

- `i` enter Insert mode
    - but for manipulating/deleting text, want to use something more than backspace
- `o` / `O` insert line below / above
- `d{motion}` delete {motion}
    - e.g. `dw` is delete word, `d$` is delete to end of line, `d0` is delete to beginning of line
- `c{motion}` change {motion}
    - e.g. `cw` is change word
    - like `d{motion}` followed by `i`
- `x` delete character (equal do `dl`)
- `s` substitute character (equal to `xi`)
- Visual mode + manipulation
    - select text, `d` to delete it or `c` to change it
- `u` to undo, `<C-r>` to redo
- `y` to copy / “yank” (some other commands like `d` also copy)
- `p` to paste
- Lots more to learn: e.g. `~` flips the case of a character

---

Counts:

You can combine nouns and verbs with a count, which will perform a given action a number of times

- `3w` move 3 words forward
- `5j` move 5 lines down
- `d7w` delete 7 words

---

Modifiers:

You can use modifiers to change the meaning of a noun

Some modifiers are `i`, which means “inner” or “inside”

and `a`, which means “around”

- `ci(` change the contents inside the current pair of parentheses
- `ci[` change the contents inside the current pair of square brackets
- `da'` delete a single-quoted string, including the surrounding single quotes

---

Demo:

Here is a broken [fizz buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) implementation:

```py
def fizz_buzz(limit):
    for i in range(limit):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            print('fizz')
        if i % 5 == 0:
            print('fizz')
        if i % 3 and i % 5:
            print(i)

def main():
    fizz_buzz(10)
```

We will fix the following issues:

- Main is never called
- Starts at 0 instead of 1
- Prints “fizz” and “buzz” on separate lines for multiples of 15
- Prints “fizz” for multiples of 5
- Uses a hard-coded argument of 10 instead of taking a command-line argument

See the lecture video for the demonstration

Compare how the above changes are made using Vim to how you might make the same edits using another program

Notice how very few keystrokes are required in Vim, allowing you to edit at the speed you think

---

Customizing Vim

Vim is customized through a plain-text configuration file in `~/.vimrc`(containing Vimscript commands)

There are probably lots of basic settings that you want to turn on

We are providing a well-documented basic config that you can use as a starting point.

We recommend using this because it fixes some of Vim’s quirky default behavior.

Download our config [here](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/files/vimrc) and save it to ~/.vimrc.

Vim is heavily customizable, and it’s worth spending time exploring customization options.

You can look at people’s dotfiles on GitHub for inspiration, for example, your instructors’ Vim configs([Anish](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc), [Jon](https://github.com/jonhoo/configs/blob/master/editor/.config/nvim/init.vim) (uses neovim), [Jose](https://github.com/JJGO/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/.vimrc))

There are lots of good blog posts on this topic too

Try **not to** copy-and-paste people’s full configuration, but read it, understand it, and take what you need.

---

Extending Vim

There are tons of plugins for extending Vim

Contrary to outdated advice that you might find on the internet, you do not need to use a plugin manager for Vim (since Vim 8.0)

Instead, you can use the built-in package management system

Simply create the directory `~/.vim/pack/vendor/start/` and put plugins in there(e.g. via `git clone`)

Here are some of our favorite plugins:

- [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim): fuzzy file finder
- [ack.vim](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim): code search
- [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree): file explorer
- [vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion): magic motions

We’re trying to avoid giving an overwhelmingly long list of plugins here

You can check out the instructors’ dotfiles([Anish](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles), [Jon](https://github.com/jonhoo/configs), [Jose](https://github.com/JJGO/dotfiles)) to see what other plugins we use

Check out [Vim Awesome](https://vimawesome.com/) for more awesome Vim plugins

There are also tons of blog posts on this topic: just search for “best Vim plugins”

Vim-mode in other programs

Many tools support Vim emulation. The quality varies from good to great; depending on the tool, it may not support the fancier Vim features, but most cover the basics pretty well

---

Shell

If you’re a Bash user, use `set -o vi`. If you use Zsh, `bindkey -v`. For Fish, `fish_vi_key_bindings`

Additionally, no matter what shell you use, you can `export EDITOR=vim`

This is the environment variable used to decide which editor is launched when a program wants to start an editor

For example, `git` will use this editor for commit messages

---

Readline

Many programs use the [GNU Readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) library for their command-line interface. Readline supports (basic) Vim emulation too, which can be enabled by adding the following line to the `~/.inputrc` file:

```rc
set editing-mode vi
```

With this setting, for example, the Python REPL will support Vim bindings.

---

Others

There are even vim keybinding extensions for web [browsers](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Vim_key_bindings_for_web_browsers) - some popular ones are [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en) for Google Chrome and [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) for Firefox

You can even get Vim bindings in [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/lambdalisue/jupyter-vim-binding)

Here is a [long list](https://reversed.top/2016-08-13/big-list-of-vim-like-software) of software with vim-like keybindings

Advanced Vim

Here are a few examples to show you the power of the editor

We can’t teach you all of these kinds of things, but you’ll learn them as you go

whenever you’re using your editor and you think “there must be a better way of doing this”, there probably is: look it up online

---

Search and replace

`:s` (substitute) command ([documentation](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace)).

- `%s/foo/bar/g`
    - replace foo with bar globally in file
- `%s/\[.*\](\(.*\))/\1/g`
    - replace named Markdown links with plain URLs

---

Multiple windows

- `:sp` / `:vsp` to split windows
- Can have multiple views of the same buffer.

---

Macros

- `q{character}` to start recording a macro in register `{character}`
- `q` to stop recording
- `@{character}` replays the macro
- Macro execution stops on error
- `{number}@{character}` executes a macro {number} times
- Macros can be recursive
    - first clear the macro with `q{character}q`
    - record the macro, with `@{character}` to invoke the macro recursively (will be a no-op until recording is complete)

---

- Example: convert xml to json ([file](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/files/example-data.xml))
    - Array of objects with keys “name” / “email”
    - Use a Python program?
    - Use sed / regexes
        - `g/people/d`
        - `%s/<person>/{/g`
        - `%s/<name>\(.*\)<\/name>/"name": "\1",/g`
        - …
    - Vim commands / macros
        - `Gdd`, `ggdd` delete first and last lines
        - Macro to format a single element (register `e`)
            - Go to line with `<name>`
            - `qe^r"f>s": "<ESC>f<C"<ESC>q`
        - Macro to format a person
            - Go to line with `<person>`
            - `qpS{<ESC>j@eA,<ESC>j@ejS},<ESC>q`
        - Macro to format a person and go to the next person
            - Go to line with `<person>`
            - `qq@pjq`
        - Execute macro until end of file
            - `999@q`
        - Manually remove last `,` and add `[` and `]` delimiters

### Notes on the class

`Ctrl-v` == `<C-v>` == `^v`

Q: Why vim has a normal mode ?

A:

   1、you will spend most of your time reading,navigating,doing small edits, instead of writing a long stream

   2、vim's interface itself is a programming language !

   It means that different key combinations have different effects, and once you learn the different effects, then you can actually combine them together

   Just like in a programming language, you can learn different functions and stuff and then glue them all together to make an interesting program.

   in the same way,

   once you learn vim's different movement and editing commands, and things like that, then you can talk to vim by programming vim through its interface !
