本节讲座，we will go through several ways in which you can improve your workflow when using the shell

We have been working with the shell for a while now, but we have mainly focused on executing different commands

We will now see how to run several processes at the same time while keeping track of them, how to stop or pause a specific process and how to make a process run in the background

We will also learn about different ways to improve your shell and other tools, by defining aliases and configuring them using dotfiles

Both of these can help you save time, e.g. by using the same configurations in all your machines without having to type long commands.

We will look at how to work with remote machines using SSH

---

Job Control

In some cases you will need to interrupt a job while it is executing, for instance if a command is taking too long to complete (such as a `find` with a very large directory structure to search through).

Most of the time, you can do `Ctrl-C` and the command will stop.

But how does this actually work and why does it sometimes fail to stop the process?

---

Killing a process

Your shell is using a UNIX communication mechanism called a **signal** to communicate information to the process

When a process receives a signal it stops its execution, deals with the signal and potentially changes the flow of execution based on the information that the signal delivered

For this reason, signals are **software interrupts**

In our case, when typing `Ctrl-C` this prompts the shell to deliver a `SIGINT` signal to the process.

Here’s a minimal example of a Python program that captures `SIGINT` and ignores it, no longer stopping.

To kill this program we can now use the `SIGQUIT` signal instead, by typing `Ctrl-\`.

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python
import signal, time

def handler(signum, time):
    print("\nI got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping")

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handler)

i = 0
while True:
    time.sleep(.1)
    print("\r{}".format(i), end="")
    i += 1
```

Here’s what happens if we send `SIGINT` twice to this program, followed by `SIGQUIT`

Note that `^` is how `Ctrl` is displayed when typed in the terminal

```shell
$ python sigint.py
24^C
I got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping
26^C
I got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping
30^\[1]    39913 quit       python sigint.py
```

While `SIGINT` and `SIGQUIT` are both usually associated with terminal related requests, a more generic signal for asking a process to exit gracefully is the `SIGTERM` signal.

To send this signal we can use the [kill](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/kill.1.html) command, with the syntax `kill -TERM <PID>`.

---

Pausing and backgrounding processes

Signals can do other things beyond killing a process.

For instance, `SIGSTOP` pauses a process. In the terminal, typing `Ctrl-Z` will prompt the shell to send a `SIGTSTP` signal, short for Terminal Stop (i.e. the terminal’s version of `SIGSTOP`).

We can then continue the paused job in the foreground or in the background using [fg](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/fg.1p.html) or [bg](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/bg.1p.html), respectively.

The [jobs](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/jobs.1p.html) command lists the unfinished jobs associated with the current terminal session.

You can refer to those jobs using their pid (you can use [pgrep](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pgrep.1.html) to find that out).

More intuitively, you can also refer to a process using the percent symbol followed by its job number (displayed by `jobs`).

To refer to **the last backgrounded job** you can use the `$!` special parameter.

One more thing to know is that the `&` suffix in a command will run the command in the background, giving you the prompt back, although it will still use the shell’s STDOUT which can be annoying (use shell redirections in that case).

![20220803134831](https://aliyun-oss-lpj.oss-cn-qingdao.aliyuncs.com/images/by-clipboard/20220803134831.png)

To background an already running program you can do `Ctrl-Z` followed by `bg`

Note that backgrounded processes are still children processes of your terminal and will die if you close the terminal (this will send yet another signal, `SIGHUP`)

To prevent that from happening you can run the program with [nohup](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/nohup.1.html) (a wrapper to ignore `SIGHUP`), or use `disown` if the process has already been started.

Alternatively, you can use a terminal multiplexer as we will see in the next section.

Below is a sample session to showcase some of these concepts.

```shell
$ sleep 1000
^Z
[1]  + 18653 suspended  sleep 1000

$ nohup sleep 2000 &
[2] 18745
appending output to nohup.out

$ jobs
[1]  + suspended  sleep 1000
[2]  - running    nohup sleep 2000

$ bg %1
[1]  - 18653 continued  sleep 1000

$ jobs
[1]  - running    sleep 1000
[2]  + running    nohup sleep 2000

$ kill -STOP %1
[1]  + 18653 suspended (signal)  sleep 1000

$ jobs
[1]  + suspended (signal)  sleep 1000
[2]  - running    nohup sleep 2000

$ kill -SIGHUP %1
[1]  + 18653 hangup     sleep 1000

$ jobs
[2]  + running    nohup sleep 2000

$ kill -SIGHUP %2

$ jobs
[2]  + running    nohup sleep 2000

$ kill %2
[2]  + 18745 terminated  nohup sleep 2000

$ jobs
```

---

A special signal is `SIGKILL` since it cannot be captured by the process and it will always terminate it immediately. However, it can have bad side effects such as leaving orphaned children processes.

You can learn more about these and other signals [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)) or typing [man signal](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html) or `kill -l`.

Terminal Multiplexers

When using the command line interface you will often want to run more than one thing at once.

For instance, you might want to run your editor and your program side by side.

Although this can be achieved by opening new terminal windows, using a terminal multiplexer is a more versatile solution.

Terminal multiplexers like [tmux](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tmux.1.html) allow you to multiplex terminal windows using panes and tabs so you can interact with multiple shell sessions. 

Moreover, terminal multiplexers let you detach a current terminal session and reattach at some point later in time.

This can make your workflow much better when working with remote machines since it avoids the need to use `nohup` and similar tricks.

---

The most popular terminal multiplexer these days is [tmux](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tmux.1.html). `tmux` is highly configurable and by using the associated keybindings you can create multiple tabs and panes and quickly navigate through them.

`tmux` expects you to know its keybindings, and they all have the form `<C-b> x` where that means (1) press `Ctrl+b`, (2) release `Ctrl+b`, and then (3) press `x`. `tmux` has the following hierarchy of objects:

---

- Sessions - a session is an independent workspace with one or more windows

    - `tmux` starts a new session.
    - `tmux new -s NAME` starts it with that name.
    - `tmux ls` lists the current sessions
    - Within tmux typing `<C-b> d` detaches the current session
    - `tmux a` attaches the last session. You can use `-t` flag to specify which

- Windows - Equivalent to tabs in editors or browsers, they are visually separate parts of the same session

    - `<C-b> c` Creates a new window. To close it you can just terminate the shells doing `<C-d>`
    - `<C-b> N` Go to the **N** th window. Note they are numbered
    - `<C-b> p` Goes to the previous window
    - `<C-b> n` Goes to the next window
    - `<C-b> ,` Rename the current window
    - `<C-b> w` List current windows

- Panes - Like vim splits, panes let you have multiple shells in the same visual display.

    - `<C-b> "` Split the current pane horizontally
    - `<C-b> %` Split the current pane vertically
    - `<C-b> <direction>` Move to the pane in the specified direction. Direction here means arrow keys.
    - `<C-b> z` Toggle zoom for the current pane
    - `<C-b> [` Start scrollback. You can then press `<space>` to start a selection and `<enter>` to copy that selection.
    - `<C-b> <space>` Cycle through pane arrangements.

For further reading, [here](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/) is a quick tutorial on `tmux` and [this](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_adv_termmux.php) has a more detailed explanation that covers the original `screen` command. You might also want to familiarize yourself with [screen](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/screen.1.html), since it comes installed in most UNIX systems.

Aliases

It can become tiresome typing long commands that involve many flags or verbose options.

For this reason, most shells support aliasing.

A shell alias is a short form for another command that your shell will replace automatically for you.

For instance, an alias in bash has the following structure:

```bash
alias alias_name="command_to_alias arg1 arg2"
```

Note that there is no space around the equal sign `=`, because [alias](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/alias.1p.html) is a shell command that takes a single argument.

---

Aliases have many convenient features:

```bash
# Make shorthands for common flags
alias ll="ls -lh"

# Save a lot of typing for common commands
alias gs="git status"
alias gc="git commit"
alias v="vim"

# Save you from mistyping
alias sl=ls

# Overwrite existing commands for better defaults
alias mv="mv -i"           # -i prompts before overwrite
alias mkdir="mkdir -p"     # -p make parent dirs as needed
alias df="df -h"           # -h prints human readable format

# Alias can be composed
alias la="ls -A"
alias lla="la -l"

# To ignore an alias run it prepended with \
\ls
# Or disable an alias altogether with unalias
unalias la

# To get an alias definition just call it with alias
alias ll
# Will print ll='ls -lh'
```

Note that aliases do not persist shell sessions by default. To make an alias persistent you need to include it in shell startup files, like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, which we are going to introduce in the next section.

---

Dotfiles

Many programs are configured using plain-text files known as dotfiles (because the file names begin with a `.`, e.g. `~/.vimrc`, so that they are hidden in the directory listing `ls` by default).

Shells are one example of programs configured with such files. On startup, your shell will read many files to load its configuration.

Depending on the shell, whether you are starting a login and/or interactive the entire process can be quite complex.

[Here](https://blog.flowblok.id.au/2013-02/shell-startup-scripts.html) is an excellent resource on the topic.

---

For `bash`, editing your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` will work in most systems. Here you can include commands that you want to run on startup, like the alias we just described or modifications to your `PATH` environment variable. In fact, many programs will ask you to include a line like `export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/program/bin"` in your shell configuration file so their binaries can be found.

Some other examples of tools that can be configured through dotfiles are:

- `bash` - `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`
- `git` - `~/.gitconfig`
- `vim` - `~/.vimrc` and the `~/.vim` folder
- `ssh` - `~/.ssh/config`
- `tmux` - `~/.tmux.conf`

How should you organize your dotfiles? They should be in their own folder, under version control, and symlinked into place using a script. This has the benefits of:

- Easy installation: if you log in to a new machine, applying your customizations will only take a minute.
- Portability: your tools will work the same way everywhere.
- Synchronization: you can update your dotfiles anywhere and keep them all in sync.
- Change tracking: you’re probably going to be maintaining your dotfiles for your entire programming career, and version history is nice to have for long-lived projects.

What should you put in your dotfiles? You can learn about your tool’s settings by reading online documentation or [man pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page).

Another great way is to search the internet for blog posts about specific programs, where authors will tell you about their preferred customizations.

Yet another way to learn about customizations is to look through other people’s dotfiles: you can find tons of [dotfiles repositories](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=dotfiles&s=stars&type=Repositories) on Github — see the most popular one [here](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) (we advise you not to blindly copy configurations though). [Here](https://dotfiles.github.io/) is another good resource on the topic.

All of the class instructors have their dotfiles publicly accessible on GitHub: [Anish](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles), [Jon](https://github.com/jonhoo/configs), [Jose](https://github.com/jjgo/dotfiles).

---

Portability

A common pain with dotfiles is that the configurations might not work when working with several machines, e.g. if they have different operating systems or shells.

Sometimes you also want some configuration to be applied only in a given machine.

There are some tricks for making this easier. If the configuration file supports it, use the equivalent of if-statements to apply machine specific customizations.

For example, your shell could have something like:

```shell
if [[ "$(uname)" == "Linux" ]]; then {do_something}; fi

# Check before using shell-specific features
if [[ "$SHELL" == "zsh" ]]; then {do_something}; fi

# You can also make it machine-specific
if [[ "$(hostname)" == "myServer" ]]; then {do_something}; fi
```

---

If the configuration file supports it, make use of includes.

For example, a `~/.gitconfig` can have a setting:

```
[include]
    path = ~/.gitconfig_local
```

And then on each machine, `~/.gitconfig_local` can contain machine-specific settings. You could even track these in a separate repository for machine-specific settings.

---

This idea is also useful if you want different programs to share some configurations. For instance, if you want both `bash` and `zsh` to share the same set of aliases you can write them under `.aliases` and have the following block in both:

```shell
# Test if ~/.aliases exists and source it
if [ -f ~/.aliases ]; then
    source ~/.aliases
fi
```

Shells & Frameworks

During shell tool and scripting we covered the `bash` shell because it is by far the most ubiquitous shell and most systems have it as the default option. Nevertheless, it is not the only option.

For example, the `zsh` shell is a superset of `bash` and provides many convenient features out of the box such as:

- Smarter globbing, `**`
- Inline globbing/wildcard expansion
- Spelling correction
- Better tab completion/selection
- Path expansion (cd /u/lo/b will expand as /usr/local/bin)

> 其实这里的说法有问题，根据维基百科的说明，[zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) 并非 [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) 的超集

---

Frameworks can improve your shell as well. Some popular general frameworks are [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) or [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), and smaller ones that focus on specific features such as [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) or [zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search).

Shells like [fish](https://fishshell.com/) include many of these user-friendly features by default. Some of these features include:

- Right prompt
- Command syntax highlighting
- History substring search
- manpage based flag completions
- Smarter autocompletion
- Prompt themes

One thing to note when using these frameworks is that they may slow down your shell, especially if the code they run is not properly optimized or it is too much code.

You can always profile it and disable the features that you do not use often or value over speed.

---

Terminal Emulators

Along with customizing your shell, it is worth spending some time figuring out your choice of terminal emulator and its settings.

There are many many terminal emulators out there (here is a [comparison](https://anarc.at/blog/2018-04-12-terminal-emulators-1/)).

Since you might be spending hundreds to thousands of hours in your terminal it pays off to look into its settings.

Some of the aspects that you may want to modify in your terminal include:

- Font choice
- Color Scheme
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Tab/Pane support
- Scrollback configuration
- Performance (some newer terminals like [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty) or [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) offer GPU acceleration).
